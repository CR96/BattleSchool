# Battle School
### Android application created as part of the final project for Honors College 202 "Coming to a Classroom Near You," Oakland University, June 2016

This project is intended to be a <b>UI design showcase*</b>. It is an interactive visual outline of a fictional game that could take place in the world of <i>Ender's Game</i> by Orson Scott Card.

## Features
- Rich custom theme implementing elements of Material Design
- Custom drawables
- Custom font
- RecyclerView with RecyclerAdapter viewholder pattern
- String and Array resources
- Animations and event timers*
- Custom MediaPlayer class for playing audio files

*<b>Note:</b> The loading screens and device connection prompt were created only as a design concept using timed animations. This application does not require an internet connection or any peripherals as it does not actually send or retrieve any data.

The file <code>FinalProject.pdf</code> contains the essay describing the "in-universe" functions of this application and their implications in the context of the literature.
